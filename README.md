this github account has been madeup for one reason and i will be honest that i have never used place like this and chances are i have very bleak chances of getting selected this time but i will give my best shot and in coming few months you will have to change your mind and wil give me scholarship for the bootcamp too. I know it and i will make it happen. :)
